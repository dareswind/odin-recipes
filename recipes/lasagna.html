        <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a 
                large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) 
                according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, 
                and set aside.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, 
                    brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over 
                    medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, 
                        Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and 
                        ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over 
                     medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. 
                     Taste and season with additional salt if desired.</li>
                     <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese,
                         ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg,
                          and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
                          <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. 
                            Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture
                             and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with 
                             remaining sauce.</li>
                             <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
                             <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining
                                 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. 
                                 Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly.
                                  Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
                                  <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
